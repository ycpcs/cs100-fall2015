- **Windows XP / Windows 7**
  1. Download Python 3.4.1 from [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.1/python-3.4.1.msi).<br>  
  2. The link above will download a .msi installer for Windows operating systems.  Run the .msi installer and accept all of the default options.<br>  
  3. Download a zip file containing the swampy 2.1 package [here](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/swampy/swampy-2.1.5.python3.zip)<br>  
  4. Unzip the swampy zip file that you downloaded in the previous step.  You should now have directory called _swampy-2.1.5_ that contains all of the swampy files.<br>  
  5. Copy all the files from the _swampy-2.1.5_ directory (**NOT** the directory itself) to the <br>
  **C:/Python34/Lib/site-packages/** directory.<br>
  You may need to create this directory.<br>
  <br>
  6. Head over to the [PyCharm website](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and follow the directions to install PyCharm on our local machine.<br><br>


- **Windows 8 / Windows 8.1**
  1. Try instructions for Windows 7 above.  If those instructions fail, goto step #2.<br>  
  2. See Dr. Babcock <br><br>

  
- **Mac OSX**
  1. Mac OS X comes preinstalled with Python 2.7.x.  However, we will be using Python 3 in CPADS.  Download Python 3.5.0 from [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.0/python-3.5.0-macosx10.6.pkg).<br>  
  2. The link above will download a .dmg (a disk image) file containing the Python installer.  Open the .pkg file to run the installer accepting all of the default options.  If you receive a message indicating that you cannot install the package because it is from an _unidentified developer_, see Apple's support document [here](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5290?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US)<br>  
  3. Download a zip file containing the swampy 2.1 package [here](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/swampy/swampy-2.1.5.python3.zip)<br>  
  4. Unzip the swampy zip file that you downloaded in the previous step.  You should now have directory called _swampy-2.1.5_ that contains all of the swampy files.<br>  
  5. Open a terminal window and type **open /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/site-packages** <br>
  6. Copy all the files from the _swampy-2.1.5_ directory (**NOT** the directory itself) to the folder window that opened in step 5.<br>  
  7. Head over to the [PyCharm website](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and follow the directions to install PyCharm on our local machine.<br><br>

- **Linux**
  1. If you're running Linux, you can probably figure this out on your own.  If you're a total Linux _noob_, goto step #2.<br>  
  2. See Dr. Babcock
