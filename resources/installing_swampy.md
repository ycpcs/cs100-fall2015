- **Windows XP / Windows 7**
  1. Download Python 3.4.1 from [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.1/python-3.4.1.msi).<br>  
  2. The link above will download a .msi installer for Windows operating systems.  Run the .msi installer and accept all of the default options.<br>  
  3. Download a zip file containing the swampy 2.1 package [here](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/swampy/swampy-2.1.5.python3.zip)<br>  
  4. Unzip the swampy zip file that you downloaded in the previous step.  You should now have directory called _swampy-2.1.5_ that contains all of the swampy files.<br>  
  5. Copy all the files from the _swampy-2.1.5_ directory (**NOT** the directory itself) to the <br>
  **C:/Python34/Lib/site-packages/** directory.<br>
  You may need to create this directory.<br>
  <br>
  6. Head over to the [PyCharm website](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and follow the directions to install PyCharm on our local machine.<br><br>


- **Windows 8 / Windows 8.1**
  1. Try instructions for Windows 7 above.  If those instructions fail, goto step #2.<br>  
  2. See Dr. Babcock <br><br>

- **Mac OSX 10.7 – 10.9 (Lion, Mountain Lion, Mavericks)**
  1. Mac OS X comes preinstalled with Python 2.7.x.  However, we will be using Python 3 in CPADS.  Download Python 3.4.1 from [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.1/python-3.4.1-macosx10.6.dmg).<br>  
  2. The link above will download a .dmg (a disk image) file containing the Python installer.  Open the .dmg file and run the **Python.mpkg** installer accepting all of the default options.  If you receive a message indicating that you cannot install the package because it is from an _unidentified developer_, see Apple's support document [here](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5290?viewlocale=en_US&locale=en_US)<br>  
  3. Download a zip file containing the swampy 2.1 package [here](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/swampy/swampy-2.1.5.python3.zip)<br>  
  4. Unzip the swampy zip file that you downloaded in the previous step.  You should now have directory called _swampy-2.1.5_ that contains all of the swampy files.<br>  
  5. Copy all the files from the _swampy-2.1.5_ directory (**NOT** the directory itself) to the <br>
  **/Macintosh_HD/Library/Python/3.4/site-packages/** directory.<br>  
  You may need to create this directory.<br>
  <br>
  Note: If you cannot see the **/Macintosh_HD/Library/** directory, you may need to access it from the Finder menu.  Click on **Finder** in your Dock, select **Go** from the Menu, choose **Go to Folder...**, and type **/Library** in the box that appears.  From here, you should be able to see the **Python** directory and proceed as directed above.<br>
  <br>
  6. Head over to the [PyCharm website](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) and follow the directions to install PyCharm on our local machine.<br><br>
  
- **Linux**
  1. If you're running Linux, you can probably figure this out on your own.  If you're a total Linux _noob_, goto step #2.<br>  
  2. See Dr. Babcock
